#Quarter_Club


[Quarter Club](https://stormy-tor-30882.herokuapp.com/)
Description:

  For this project on CRUD functionality, I chose to make a website about quarter machine toys.  So, a user can add a location and give it a title, address, and what quarter machines they have.  This site would be useful for people who collect quarter machine toys.  A user can also edit or delete a location, or just click on it to see more information.  A user can also create a user name and password.

Technologies Used:

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, node.js, express.js, bCrypt, trello, mongoDB, Mongoose
Planning: Trello
Text editor: Sublime Text 3

Features:

- Users can create a username and password with encryption
